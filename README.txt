Project Conway: Getting Started Guide
This is a document to support the usage of software required in the running of Project Conway,
although other platforms will work with manual setup, all installation scripts and documentation
were written for a Debian based system.

Please see Project_Conway_user_guide.pdf for a full guide on how to use this software.

Physical Computing â€“ A Large `Game of Life' Display
Physical Computing is the building of digital systems that respond to the analog world. Frequently
this is applied and expressed in interactive art installations.

A company has approached Tinkersoc to build a large interactive `Game of Life' display for an art museum
in Canterbury. `Game of Life' is a cellular automata simulation by John Conway, where square cells interact
with each other and during each step of the simulation can follow one of four transitions.

For this project, Tinkersoc will build the hardware (driven by a Raspberry Pi), but requires a project group
to develop the software that will drive the panel, play the simulation and allow visitors, through a web-based
interface, to interact with it.

This project will involve working with multiple stakeholders and a real client. As such, there will be deadlines
for some deliverables and the project has a real use. There is a degree of flexibility in adding your own features.
One suggestion is to utilise the DSP functions on the Rasp Pi to produce generative `music' from the current state
of simulation.

The challenge of this project comes from the integration of several components, to do this; you will need to know
 or be willing to learn, how to interact with low-level hardware through your chosen programming language and the
 development of interactive mobile web applications (HTML5).
